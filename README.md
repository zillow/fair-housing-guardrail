## Features
**Compliance Detection**: Fair Housing Guardrail utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to identify content that may violate fair housing and fair lending laws.

**Customizable Stop List**: The tool demonstrates incorporating a curated list of terms and phrases commonly associated with discriminatory language, helping to flag potentially non-compliant content. Users may modify the sample stop list to add phrases relevant for their scenario.

**Customizable BERT-based Classifier**: Fair Housing Guardrail employs a fine-tuned BERT-based classifier to analyze text and determine whether it aligns with fair housing and fair lending regulations. Users can finetune the classifier to fit their specific needs and requirements on their own data, allowing for tailored compliance checks.

## How It Works
Fair Housing Guardrail works by taking input text and running it through both the stop list and the fine-tuned BERT-based classifier. If the text contains any flagged terms or if the classifier determines it to be non-compliant, the tool will label the content accordingly, providing an opportunity to review and revise the content as necessary.
